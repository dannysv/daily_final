its so hard to stay in the moment and know that we do not control persons, places, or things.
I get really OCD about things stressful day yesterday taking my son with heart surgeries for 6 month check up.
then the contractor working on my house has not shown up for 2 days (excuses) this has been going on for 6 weeks.
so I felt the code resentment building so I asked him to finish by this wednesday  just a small thing that he finally started and that the rest I would have done by someone else.
leaving for florida this thrusday to go see my anal judgmental son.
only the grandkids would get me to stay with him otherwise.
so between 3-4 this am awake with all these thoughts racing through my mind.
any advise on how to shut down the mind and stay in the moment.
thanks
I am better then yesterday.
I have a class today for 2 hours.
It's also a test.
What happens when I concentrate..I fed this am, let out the dogs, and got my wife breakfast.
She is sick, but will drive me to the class.
I've lost almost ten pounds in the last six weeks and I'm still total frustrated.
All of my jeans are still too tight!
I thought that with running at least 20 minutes a day and eating less I would at the very least my clothes would be a tiny bit looser, but I swear they're tighter!!!
Grrrrrrr!
Anyone else having this problem?
?
Hi everyone,.I am going to my first GA meeting tonight and am having butterflies in my stomach thinking that I will have to talk and what if somebody recognizes me.I guess they are all in similar situations like me but still....It is 7 days today that I didn't place a bet.I saw therapist yesterday first time as well.I am such a mess right now, so much guilt inside, but want to give my all to fight this insidious disease one day at the time.
Thanks so much for the hug!
Moms next appointment is Sept 12 so we will hear results from the tests then.
The doctor is very good to us.
He said the other day not to go overboard on the antibiotics so the good bacteria will help out her digestion, etc.
Her potassium is lower than it should be.
We have the potassium bottle with her meals so we don't forget and also the B100's.
She is doing well remembering them and her regular meds.
Her thryoid seems to be straightened out---thank GOD!
.Her problem now is the itching.
She can't get any rest for that and she says she is getting so sore from scratching.
.If we could just calm down the itching, she would feel much better..Any ideas there?
?.Take care.Mary

This actually started because of another post, but I would like to get everyone's input - What does it mean to YOU to heal from abuse?
We throw that term around a lot, but it can mean very different things to different people - .To me, healing from my abuse means that I no longer allow the abuse to dominate my life or my life choices any longer.
And I feel I have obtained ownership over my life.
I don't dwell on the abuse any longer, but I can (almost) think about it like any other negative thing that occurred to me.
I do have my share of remaining side effects of the abuse, but I see myself as having obtained a higher level of healing' than I thought I would when I was younger.
I still require medication to stabilize, but in my opinion this is still a form of healing, as it works for me - I am happy where I am.
But is that all it is - ?
Being happy with where you are?
.So - What does healing from abuse mean to you?.I am interested on getting your other views about this..Thanks -.Refuse2quit

Hi .I need help!
I found an adoption agency which I really liked but I am just scared to go through that without a lawyer.
I went for support to a lawyer which did my parents will and she promised to helped, but she didn't.
Do you know how  to find a good adoption lawyer?
I'm realizing I justify staying married to him by weighing the amount of time he is a hard working,sober, nice guy vs the time he is an evil beast..This sounds stupid on paper so why am I doing this?
My health and happiness comes down to a matter of percentages and I can't stop this way of thinking to save my life..He is kind a lot of the time but when he chooses to feed his addiction it feels like the end of the world.
He goes a while without severe damage but then the monster comes back to mess my world up.
He cant possibly mean anything good he says to me because love does not hurt.I know because I love him and I would never hurt him or turn on him for anything.
Where did I get the idea he ever loved me?
Its been 12 years and I feel so freaking powerless against his hold on me.I'm getting smarter but feeling no less bound by my vows.I have sacrificed my lifelong dream of adopting a child,struggled financially,given up any social life,have not been able to rescue dogs like I want to all because I will never subject a child,dog,or friend to his behavior for any amount of time.
And I do this all to spend time with a part-time so called husband when he decides to grace me with his sober presence.
I never dated an addict prior to him and had no idea of the pain I was in for, I thought he was the love of my life not a constant threat to my heart and happiness .Anyone else staying because the good outweighs the bad in your mind?
Wish there was a surgery to fix my mind.Thanks for listening.
Hey there,.My name is Rikky and I'm 16.
When I was 11 a family member I was living with started sexually abusing me.
He threatened me that if I ever told anyone he would kill me and I believed him because he beat me up a lot.
No one ever noticed, I was so ashamed I thought it was all my fault and I hid it from everyone.
The abuse continued for about 12 months until I told my best friend what was happening because she started noticing bruises and she walked in on my crying and bleeding in a corner of my room when she had a sleepover at my house.
She made me tell the head teacher at my school and they immediately called my father (who I wasn't staying with at the time) he got on the next flight to the town I was staying in and until he could get there I stayed at my friend's house.
The police interviewed me, but I was so scared I could barely talk to them.
Once they had interviewed me and my Dad arrived they talked with him about building a case against the family member that did it.
My Dad decided not to form a case because he didn't want to break up the family...He got away with it.
He graduated school and now has a job.
He has no criminal record and he is so much more successful than I am...I still have flashbacks, I dropped out of school and developed depression and anxiety.
.No one else in my family believes me...so I moved out of home and I live with another family now.
I'm trying to move on, but its so hard at times....Sorry my story is such a downer and I try to keep everything positive.
Anyway, just looking for people who understand what I have been through.
I hope you guys can help me and I you :)
So yesterday my man bought me an aloe vera plant.
I told him I really wanted one, so he got me one.
That is so sweet.
Anyway, he cut it up for me and put the fleshy part on my eczema on my ankle and heel and covered it up with some bandaids.
I have not been itchy at all, and I have high hopes of my skin being healed.
I will let you all know what my results are.
I should have taken before pictures so you could see the afters.
Anyone else have stories or info to share regarding aloe vera treating/curing eczema?
If so, please share.
Thanks.
Our grandkids have been with us for almost 4 years (ages 6.5 and 3.5).
We just got the final order granting TPR - bio mom consented.
There is a 30 day appeal time period - which we have one week left, then we will be filing for the adoption.
.Bio-mom has not been in the picture much (in and out of drug treatment programs) but since the TPR stuff started, she has been this controlled, fun mom with the kids - calling and visiting like she was supposed to years ago.
This has totally thrown the kids into confusion.
They think that mom is better and that they are going to live with her.
The older one is overly emotional (which he had finally outgrown months before) and the younger one is being totally defiant - more than a typical 3 year old.
Their counselor said that bio-mom needs to step back out and it would be beneficial for the kids to quit calling bio-mom mom and we should work on having the kids call us mom and dad.
We don't know what is right.
And bio-mom is now throwing a fit.
We just want what is best for the kids..Does anyone have any advice on which is better for the kids in the long run?
Do we let them continue to call bio-mom Mom, even after the adoption?
We don't plan on cutting her out of their lives - and will always be honest about the biological facts.
Or would it be better to have them call us mom and dad?
Right now they use the fact of your not my mom - more or less I don't have to listen to you.
So confused.........
hi!
this is my first time here im 24 years old and had a miscarrage in mid april this year and for more than a month and started spotting till my normal cycle first week of june and after it i started what my GP called chronic spotting up to date had a scanj done which showed no debree left and FBC tests which confirmed my blood levels and contents normal and she prescribed family planning pills for hormonal balance and reffered me to a gynae who did some cervix and vaginal tests which she said they were ok and that the blood colour was normal as well.
she then suggested it could be endometrium cancer and required me to have some Bhcg tests and expecting results next week.
I'm really worried could it really be cancer or she mmade an error in diagnising or should i get another gynae to look at me.worried and scared to death.CK93
Though it doesn't apply to my situation, I've read that the highest number of affairs happen in the workplace.
It would seem a sampling of BSs here would confirm that..It got me to thinking.
This really doesn't have a point, or indicate that it was bad that women entered the workforce in greater numbers, but more of a Hummm thought..Statistics I've seen say that since the 60s and 70s, cheating among women has risen steadily.
If I recall, it used to be in the low teens, now in the high twenties..That also corresponds with women starting to work more.
Makes sense that the more you put men and women together, the more opportunities that will present themselves..Last boss I had was a woman, and we spent lots of time together.
Yes, on business, but fact is I had tons more interaction with her than I did with Gabi five days of each week.
.While nothing ever happened, I worried that if she ever wanted to, she could accuse me, and there would be little I could have done to disprove it.
When that happens, people assume guilty until proven innocent.
With no way to prove it didn't happen, you'd be toast..Anyway, just a thought I had.
Our son is 6 110# and a bull in a china shop.
This is the 2nd time in 6 months the police have been called for a bruise on his body.
Yesterday he was taken of his bus after school and we have no idea where he is.
CPS has placed him in a safe home and we have to wait til Tuesday to see a judge.
He is mentally handicap as well as verbally slow so they can't really understand him.
We have never hurt this child and would never think of it but now we have to fight to have him returned over something no one asked us to explain.
He was fine when he went to school yesterday morning so we can't begin to understand what they are talking about.
How do we protect this child?
He believes anything he is told.

Has anyone had any symptoms of chest and rib area tightening like someone has a band around you and squeezing it and you can't catch a breath???
?
This heat is killing me!
I know most of you have problems with storms and such but I don't for me it is the nice hot days that do me in.
I am sure it has to do with fluid retention, kind of like being pregnant in the summer and your ankles/fingers swell up.
I don't know why I retain so much fluid (kidney function is fine and am on a low sodium diet).
.Do any of you have problems when it is hot out with fluid retention and does it make your IIH worse?.Thanks,.Danielle
I just got out of the hospital Friday night, so its been 5 days since my operation.
I am dealing with the pain with as little meds as possible, but the other systems are really getting me down.
I was wondering if this is pretty common to feel this way?
I sure would like to talk to someone who has just recently went through this as well.
.
I lost a pint of blood during the operation, so that might be a big factor, I'm not sure.
I knew to expect really bad pain & tiredness, but I didn't know I would only be able to stay up about 30 min at a time.
I hate that I have to just lay on my back.
I get sick at my tummy, especially late in the evening & dizzy at times as well.
I am so down, bored and just want to feel better.
Thanks, Turtle
I'm buying a house on contract and barely making ends meet.
The balloon payment came due 2 years ago and the guy extended the contract but now I have to pay up or give up the house..The local bank says my debt to income ratio is too bad, they won't loan me anything.
A guy at Quicken Loans wants $400 as an appraisal fee.
I just don't have it and I'm hesitant to charge it to my credit card..Any advice on how the process works would be appreciated.
is anyone on immunosuppressants for their scleroderma?
My rheumatologist said it's time for us to start thinking about getting me on them but she said there are specific ones that are used for scleroderma.
I know people who have been on them for RA and the side effects were just awful.
Does anyone have experience with ones that are used specifically for SSc?
Are any less prone to side effects than others?
Any time I am put on a new Rx I tend to get every side effect listed.
Thanks for your help and any info you can provide!

Hi Everyone,.I started taking my Flexeril today and noticed that the bottle directs me to take it once a day.
Is this common?
Any pain medicine I've ever taken is more as needed so I'm really not familiar with taking something daily..My rheumatologist prescribed it along with the Cymbalta because I wasn't comfortable taking a narcotic not to mention it's a crap shoot as to it making me nauseous or not.
We just staggered the start times a bit to catch any side effects or to see if one med didn't actually help..Also, can I still take my Tylenol arthritis/pm if I need it?
I didn't think to ask these things because I didn't realize the Flexeril would be daily..If it works I am hoping he will continue to prescribe it.
I really don't want to go to a pain clinic.
I had a horrible experience in my early 20s when they were trying to get the endometriosis under control.
They basically told me it was all in my head.
(Then I had to have 2 more surgeries to remove the massive amounts of scar tissue.
Go figure.)
Any experiences with Botox injections for the feet?
Costs?.Are there any good doctors in Michigan?
.Thanks!
I am wondering if anyone out there can shed a little light.
I have to have the radiation treatments for my eyes.
What are some of the side effects, does it make you feel sick.?
I guess that I am just a little neverous.
.I feel like I am just going downhill.
I cry everyday and for no reason what so ever, guess I am just tired of the looks and questions I get on a daily basis.
I feel like I am going crazy , can't remember things, it takes every thing I have to get up and come to work everyday.
Does this worn out feeling ever go away.
I have missed so much work from GD this every.
.Sorry for the venting I guess I just feel like no one understands, the pain and suffering I am going through on a daily basis.
It's hard to explain to someone when you tell them I don't feel good and they ask well how do not feel good.
Hello,.My name is Megan Morrison and I am a reporter for the Medill News Service in Chicago, Illinois..I am interested to speak with someone about their experience using saw palmetto for a piece about a new study on the supplement.

Hi, I'm 17 years old and I have been struggling with trichotillomania since I was 6.
When I first started pulling out my eyebrows I thought at first that I was just making them spiky, but then my parents realized that I was actually pulling out my eyebrows.
I don't really know what triggered me to start pulling my eyebrows out because when I first started I was just sitting in front of my TV watching a Disney movie, Ice Princess.
Maybe watching TV is my trigger, but I doubt it because TV is really the only thing that makes me happy anymore.
After my parents realized I was pulling my hair out they kept telling me to stop pulling and gave me punishments for pulling.
At the time, before I realized I probably had Trichotillomania, I developed/ have social anxiety.
I didn't/don't make eye contact with people because I was/am ashamed that I don't have any eyebrows.
I've asked my parents to take me to the doctor so that they could try and prescribe me something and my mom always says she wills but never gets to it.
It wasn't until she noticed that my 3 year old little sister liked to pick at her face, making her develop as she calls them spots on her face that my mom finally decidedto take HER to the doctor after asking me what made me start to pull.I absolutelyhate to talk about it or even bring out the subject.
When people ask me what happenedto my eyebrows I either tell them a lie or try and change the subject without the person noticing.
I had to ask my mom if I could come to so that I could talk to the doctor about my pulling.
In the end, it turned out to be a bust because my doctor advised me to go to this therapist and I went to one session with her but wasn't able to continue because she was pregnantand taking maternity leave so... After that, my mom still continues to say she'll take make a new appointment for me, but she's busy with work and I get it.Since realizing that I probably have trichotillomania it's a bit comforting to know that I'm not the only one who pulls their hair out but at the same time scary to know that it's a mental illness, because growing up mental illnesses means that you were sick and had to be put in like a psych ward at some hospital.
I've also realized that my social anxiety probably correlates to my pulling, but it still sucks because I don't interact a lot with people.
My mom makes jokes about my social anxiety but most of the time I feel like she's making fun of me.
Once she told me that I should take social classes to learn how to be social and another time she compared me to a kid with Aspergers, due to my lack of socialness I tend to make comments that unintentionally come off rude.
On top of all that I also have anxiety.
I just want to feel happy again, and feel like I can have a conversation with a person or a guy without feeling embarrassedor ashamedthat I don't have any eyebrows and I want to get help or at least learn what I need to do to break this long time habit.
I am hoping that she can assist me with my son's behaviors at school..  R'Lee is cutting paper in the back of the classroom and is not doing his work.
He stands in line and blows into the faces of the other kids.
He also gets territorial and doesn't pick up his own messes at school.
.
I know that America's schools suck the creativity of our children and I also know how teachers can be mean, but he has to learn the basics of discipline and how to function...    Anway, I identify with my son on so many levels and I think that it is very cool that he can imagine things in a three dimensional way, I just wish that he would get a grip on some of his behaviors.
I know how it goes.
It took me 4 years at my own job to behave right and get social cues (I have bipolar and PTSD very badly).
.
I just hope that Temple can show me a few pointers about how to deal with stimga, prejudice and how to translate R'Lee's experiences and help him to cope with monotony, authority and the general neurotypical population...Thanks,.4My

Was watching a new TV Drama called the last ship.
In a nutshell a mutated virus has basically killed 98% of the world.
This navy ship is almost all of the remaining humans other than a few here and there.
They go to Gitmonto break into the navy hospital to get some meds to use in creating a cure.
The researcher tells the sailors to look for Inteferon and ribavirin.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.Susan and I just looked at each other and laughed.
We couldn't believe they didn't mention Sovaldi.
I've been reading the messages from spouses/significant others of gaming addicts.
I am also living with an addict and would like to know if anyone can recommend a face-to-face support group that I can look into.
A post on another site recommended Al-anon,.I am in the process of moving out and into my own apartment.
I have been with this person for 13 years, and this break-up is literally tearing me apart..I recently found out he is seeing someone else who also plays the game he plays - Rift.
When confronted, he told me he can't give me what I need, but he couldn't tell me what that is.
He said something is missing, and later clarified that to be intimacy.
Gee, it's hard to have intimacy in a relationship, when one of the people in the relationship spends all of his free time playing a game.
.This is the 2nd time this has happened.
The first time was 5 years ago when he was playing WOW.
That time, he moved her here and in with her.
The relationship lasted about  6 months.
I stupidly persued him and took him back mainly because I love him so much and had difficulty living alone.
When we got back together, he wasn't playing as ofthen as he had been in the past.
He spent time with me and life was good.
Unfortunately, after I moved back in with him, he slowly but surely increased his gaming..He holds down a good job, although one he hates and feels like an outcast.
His people skills are lacking.
He has no friends other than those he games with.
A few of these friends go from game to game to game with him.
He went from UO to WOW and now plays Rift.
.So, here I go again.
I need a support group that I can attend to help me heal and deal with life without him.
Are there online meetings I can attend?
I need something to help get me through the next few months.
I don't know that reading and writing forum posts is going to be enough.
I don't have health insurance, and can't afford to see a psychologist.
I don't know anyone but my ex and my 2 coworkers.
My family doesn't live nearby.
I've spent the past 13 years taking care of him instead of myself, and he not being a social person, we never had any real life friends..Thanks for listening.
Okay, so I am 35 weeks pregnant with twins.
My doctor is trying to push this pregnancy to full term because the babies are growing so well.
They have been gaining weight as if there was only one baby inside.
Well because of this I have been in so much pain and discomfort.
My stomach is so distented that I am larger than a woman at 40 weeks.
I can't move around well, stand up straight, sleep at all because of my hips and my feet are so swollen that I can't fit into any shoes anymore.
Well because of this discomfort, I have begun to say that I wish the doctor would have me go into labor sooner than 38 weeks because of all the discomfort.
Well my husband has begun saying that I am complaining to much and I just need to suck it up and deal with it.
I was completely shocked by this.
I have had three miscarriages until this pregnancy so because of that I haven't complained at all during this pregnancy until now.
It hasn't been an easy pregnancy because it is twins so the morning sickness lasted well into the 24 week.
I didn't even complain during that and I ended up on a zofran pump so I could keep food down.
I am just shocked that I opened my mouth at 34 weeks to complain that I am uncomfortable and the moment I do my husband starts saying I just need to suck it up.
Has anyone else's husband at the end said something like that?
Thanks for listening to me vent.
My husband and I were to have our monthly supervised visit with our grandkids today and Friday the caseworker called to say our visits were suspended due to a report that came into her office about my daughter.
When I asked what that has to do with our supervised visits she said your right but said today is Friday and I won't be able to look into the report till Monday, so no visit... My daughter doesn't live with us, my daughter and I haven't even seen each other since the last BS hearing, but I can't see the kids cause of a report about my daughter????
Oh, and guess what, it was the same caseworker.
when I asked why she was calling me with this information, she informed me that the case was given back to her due to the hearing coming up Aug. 3rd.
.Yes, I have called the attorney, and e-mailed the attorney who has a call into the AG office.
waiting for a call back still.
I have called the agencies I have talked to  assist in helping me get my GK's back.
I just mailed another grievance to the Governor's office...Sad thing is...I didn't cry this time.
I'm getting so use to CPS and their doings nothing is fazing me anymore.
The one thing I can say, My Isabell and Zachary you are the first thing I think of when I awake and your names are the last I speak when I fall a sleep....I love you
I received the first test results today.
They are called Compound Disc Diffusion Results.
They did 2 trials and the results were the same.
The lab stated,  The results appear to be reproducible..The first tests are for skin flora and Mrsa.
So, this is the topical application.
The Zone of Inhibition or kill zone was significantly larger than the area where it was applied.
So, applied topically , it killed ALL the bacteria it was applied to!
(And then some.)
There are also some very interesting things going on in the center of the slide.
Not really sure what that's all about.
I will speak with the lab tomorrow.
If I can get it figured out,I will post the pictures.
The internal tests should be done this week.
My story: had a son naturally 16 yrs ago with my wife.
We took it for granted (7yrs) that when the time was right...we could have another child.
Wrong!
We got tested, and I have a very low sperm count (1-2 million) due probably to the retrograde ejaculation I experience.
We had a really good Fertility doctor....and about year and half later....our daughter was born thru IVF (stored my sperm and injected into her eggs).What I want to know is...is there more info on retrograde ejac...that includes more than a definition and symptoms.
I want to know to what degree I have etc...
I was just wondering if anyone else has a flare whenever they have an infection or have to take antibiotics.
I seem to flare every time I take antibiotics.
I am not sure if it is the antibiotics or the infection.
Anybody go through something similar?
Up until about a year ago...my..now 18 year old son had never given us any trouble.
When he turned 17, something just clicked/changed in him.
He had always been quite and pretty much stayed to himself.
He had a few close friends who shared his interest in gaming and that was about it.
I would always compliment him on how proud I was that he didn't seem to be drawn to what so many of his peers were doing....pot/drinking/etc.
He, himself would not talk bad about them but would express his thoughts on why he didn't understand why those kids did those things.
Then he turned 17 and started driving.
I think he got tired of being so quiet and the shy one and he got with a group of kids who drank/smoked pot..etccc.
He seemed very happy that he had found a group that had embraced and accepted him.
But, we all know that it doesn't take much for some druggie or alchy to embrace you..as long as your in the mudpuddle with them and they're getting their high.
Anyway, he landed himself in some trouble...he and 2 of his friends were caught by the law with marijuana.
My son was charged with simple possession.
We go on June 14th to get his punishment.
After he got in trouble, for about a week, he was very remorseful and on his own..had sworn these people off.
Then he got bored and within 2 weeks...he was wanting to hang out with them again.
My house used to be the hangout for the kids when they were younger, now you never see kids over here because I don't allow drinking or pot smoking.....( I mean DUH!!
what kind of parent allows that kind of stuff?)
This one friend he has inparticular, has parents who let all the kids come over and get high and drunk or whatever else they want.
We found out just a day or so ago, that the father at this household had offered my son a couple of pot plants...we found this out because my son told someone he thought wouldn't tell us...but he was wrong.
My son still lives at home and recently graduated High School.
He has a job but doesn't make near enough to support himself.
He talks military but can't really do anything about that until all this legal junk is over and that's if he's even serious about it to begin with.
He lacks focus and direction and I feel like if we don't get a hold of him fast then he is going to spiral at stealth speed into some loser druggie life.
So many people say that when they're 18, there's nothing more you can do.
But seeing as he is still dependent on us to a great degree....doesn't that give us some say so?
After hearing about the pot plant incident....his father told him that he wasn't allowed to go to this certain guys house anymore.
While I agree with that....it scares me that it will push him to want to be around that junk even more.
I feel like I lose either way....on the one hand I can let him go, make his mistakes and hopefully learn from them...but the mistakes he is making seem so huge.
On the other hand we can do the my house my rules things....and I'm afraid it will backfire.
Does anyone have any advice for me?
Thanks
its been 8 weeks for me, not along time but still time.
I think back to his death and the days after that.
I realize how far I have come from that dark time.
I\u2019m feeling stronger than I have in awhile.
I still miss him every minute of the day and I have days where I\u2019m close to tears but I have made progress.
So tonight I\u2019m grateful for the small steps I\u2019m making.
Hope everyone has a good Easter.
Hugs
I was diagnosed just a few months with Sjogrens but they tell me it is secondary to RA.
The pain in my hips, wrists and feet just seem to be getting worse.
With persistant elevated LFTs, i have to limit my intake of any NSAIDS.
I started Plaquenil November 2015 and have not had any relief.
I know it can take months for changes but Im not sure I can take anymore pain.
Does anyone else have problems with insomnia?
I just really feel like a mess.
This isnt like me.
I feel like I have aged 20 years in a matter of months.
I badly need surgery on my nose because I cant take this any longer.
I have medicaid and I dont think it covers any plastic surgery.
I need help finding a new surgeon because the one I had previously does not accept medicaid.
I had a skin graft done on my nose but I still have scars and would like to get rid of them.
Any suggestions would be appreciated!
My partner has had a herion addiction most of is adult life - hes 35.
He was clean for 6 years then relapsed 18 months ago.
He went in to detox at the end of Feb this year and blossomed.
Now its June and all the signs are there and I have had pretty clear comfirmation that he has relapsed..The problem is that he is still going to the meetings and doing the CA 12 step program - he is even meeting with his sponser this evening to go through one of the big steps - I think it is to do with all the harms that you have ever done..He said to me(before the relapse)that he never tried this method and felt really confident that this was the way forward for him..I am on an emiotional rollercoster again..I swore to myself that I would leave if he used again.
Am I kidding myself in thinking I should stay as he is putting in so much effort even though he has lied about his using.
.The big problem I guess is that I love him so much I dont know what to do for the best and that is all I really want to do.
When I separated from my ex-wife, we were very deep in the hole with past due bills... from credit cards, mortgage, loans, and medical bills..The last thing I worried about or even cared about was my credit report or what my score was.
I knew it was shot and there was no quick fix for it..I knew a credit score of 850 was perfect and 300 was the worst.
If possible, I was about 299.
LOL.Well, in January it will be four years since this new life started.
On another thread there was some talk about scores.
I finally got the courage to get a report and get my scores..The report went back 12 years.
The first three years were great.
Then five years of hell.
Many 30 day late payments, as well as 60 day late, 90 and even 120.
If there was a silver lining around those dark clouds it was the line that said  paid in full, to all those bills that I was so far behind on.
The major blemish was losing the house....But then to look at the last four years with no late payments made me feel like maybe I had turned the corner..Then the scores... far from perfect but a lot farther away from 300 then I thought it would be.
Going on a generic scale of  poor-fair-good-great I'm in the middle of fair.
I do believe if I keep things going the way I have been, that by this time next year I should be in the good range....Thank you God for a second chance at financial comfort...
Co-signing someone's bullshit can kill them.
Therefore i will not lie to someone and tell them when they are on Suboxone, Methadone or any other drug replacement therapy that they are clean.
Because THEY ARE NOT CLEAN.
I will not tell someone that if they can use one a week it is a good idea.
I will not tell them the stupid nonsense they want to hear in order to continue in their sick behaviors.
Addiction is a deadly disease, and people die each and every day from it.
The fact of the matter is when we use we lose.
Whether it be quickly or slowly it is all downhill when we pick up.
I wish everyone in the group success.
But DO NOT ask me to co-sign your bullshit.
I'm 20 years old, I was just diagnosed with HPV yesterday, I haven't eaten or slept I'm a mess and I cant bring my self to think of what I am going to say to my partner.
I don't know if he was carrying it or if I contracted it and it is just appearing now.
My doctor took 3 seconds and looked and said oh its HPV genital warts she didn't take a test or anything just like that I went from being a 20 year old to a 20 year old with HPV and no idea what to do, I still have no idea.
I told my mom I was going to commit suicide and I am seriously considering it, I know it would hurt a many people around me but I cant bear this pain eating away at my heart and soul.
If anyone can help please say anything, I have been reading online that if you build up your immune system it goes away and you become immune to the strand you have.
(is that true?)
I am also going to get the Gardasil shot to prevent me from getting other strands.
I'm scared to death and don't know how I can have a sex life or anything.
Please help me

Of the HRT.
Not feeling any relief yet.
Doc said won't for at least three days.
Last visit she said look at the bright side, now you will have cleavage.
Will the HRT make my boobs bigger?
That would be a benefit for me.
Small busted always have been.
Gotta look at whatever bright side I can right now!
so why is it that i sleep like crap after the 2nd dose of xyrem???
I cant sleep more than 6 hours a night.
i want to travel to america with M however ive been both sectioned and arrested on quite a few occassions.
I have not been convicted of any crime.
I was arrested then realised the act had happened because i was mentally unwell and let go.
.Im really anxious i would love to go travelling and especially M would love it.
Itd be a huge shame if we cant go together ever.

Very new to this site but I recently loss my son (12/21/17) he was 19 years old and was caught up in a very disturbing situation.
As of know I'm not sure if his death is being investigated as a homicide so my feelings are all over the place ; mad, sad, hatred, guilt, that's just to name a few.
My reason for coming here is because I'm sick of hearingI don't know what you're going through but I would like to offer my condolences don't get me wrong I appreciate all of the support,p prayers, and condolences but I honestly want to hear from people who KNOW what I'm feeling and understand my pain if that makes sense?
my cs is unsure if he wanrs to stay on the marriage, he's overall uncooperative but has agreed to go to couples therapy, should we give it a try?

Good Morning!.Well it's been a while since I've connected with you.
In Dec I was put on a daily dose of MMI at .625mg per day rather then a 1.25 every other day.
It took about 4 weeks and since then I have been feeling great - almost hesitate to use that word....:))  I put off having labs done at 6 weeks until today which is right at 10 weeks....I really don't want to know what the numbers say.
I feel really good and have been exercising hard, able to sleep for the most part.
I know I am such a chicken about the results but you know the old adage - If it ain't broke don't fix it....that's where I feel like I am these days....:)) .I sure couldn't have gotten this far without you and your support.
You are such a giving and caring group.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I will keep you posted and I am praying that I don't have any surprises by the numbers  but its hard to predict anything when Graves is involved as we all know..Thank you again..Cindeeh
This doesn't happen often but today I was walking with a friend in town and came close to having an orgasm while walking.I had a strong tingling sensation in my left ovary that radieated down into the left side of my vagina and cervix.
Every time  I put my left foot down I felt like I was gonna orgasm.
Despite it feeling nice it was frustrating and embarrassing....anyone else ever had this before, I wasn't even thinking about sex.
My vagina was getting very turned on and wet.
anyone here ever had heart valve replacement?
especially aortic valve?
thanks.

I am Ronald I am 13 and I do not know how to tell my parents that I am trans I would like to be called Cadell but as I said I don\u2019t know how to tell my parents.
I know my mom would be supporting but my dad and step mom not so much.
I see a lot of comments on this site from women about their various tools for self gratification.
I am wondering, what do you ladies use as inspiration for those times when Bob is around?
We know what most guys do, what do the ladies think about or look at?

I feel like I cant breathe, and I cant help long for death, or a way out.
Here is a little background about me.
I am still studying at university, under my parents house (or I couldnt have a chance to get my degree which is one of my dreams btw), and I have a chronic illness which makes it hard for me to work, in other words I dont have money for myself, which is why I am still with my parents.
And I am currently waiting for surgery to take out a huge cyst.
And amogst this... my parents relationship is giving me so much anxiety.
The anxiety is so severe that it makes me feel suicidal..I cant help hate my father, and how he treats me mother.
He verbally abuses her, calling her whore and bitch etc.
And last night he physically hurt her, pulling her hair, taring her clothes and pushing her outside the house..How can you love a man (even if its your father) who acts like such a monster?.He makes up excuses, like stress from work and all.
Oh that he diabetic and yet he is drinking alcohal.
is having diabetes even a good validation to act so cruel and brutal?
when he is the one drinking alcohal....He has done things like this to me, not as severe as my mom, but he has literally called me nothing and Im a piece of shit because he has to always be right.
When I was a teenager, he literally took my phone and smashed it right infront of me... How can I even call this man my father??
He is the kinda person that knows everything and doesnt care.
As he says to me and my mom, every day I dont care as if we are nothing.
And he complains Im depressed over nothing... its like he is making himself miserable and everyone around him is being punished for his misery.
And my mom is the main target..I had to finally voice out my feelings to my mom after last nights incident.
As this was not the first time this has happened where he literally pushed her out the door, and I am so scared, so awfully scared for my life.
And She has this mentality No, we cant leave him, we have to protect your dad!
dont disrespect him.are you kidding me?.BUT LOOK AT HOW HE IS TREATING YOU and she is enabling it.
then who will protect her from him?
And she looks at me like im her fcking solution.
I really cant handle this shit.. it makes me want to find any kind of escape, that id even opt for suicide..Why me?
why me?
why me?
And My anxiety is screaming at me that no one cares about my pain.
My struggle with my own illness, why do I HAVE TO take care of them?
when I have always felt so emotionally isolated and they (my family) seems to bullying me into silence.
I feel so empty, I feel weak and helpless and the thoughts of death seems like a tempting light out of the darkness of this house that I have become to loathe..And my mom is begging me to love him, BUT HOW CAN I??
i just hate him so much.
I cant even understand why she loves this monster.
how can anyone love such a monster?
:(
Why on earth did DS get rid of the instant chat messenger on here!?
It was a way for people in need and people who were lonely to communicate as well as others in general without having to give out prsonal info like numbers, e-mails, etc..I hate that they did that.
POOR CHOICE
Saw family dr today to refill prescriptions.
He says ,You know that with chronic pancreatitis , you will have pain for a long time.
NO SHIT!!

I was discussing my Vertigo with a friend and she inquired as to whether I had tried the wrist bands they sell for motion sickness.
No, I had not.
I have seen them before, but always dismissed them as quackery.
However, after three years of Vertigo, one gets desperate.
So I went online..I found a variety of wrist bands online: Psi Bands, Queasy Beads,  Sca-Bands, and Bio-Bands.
And I'm sure that there are more.
Most mention Vertigo among the many ailments they prevent, with motion sickness at the top.
It would seem that acupressure has something to do with their success..Now the big question:  Has anyone here actually tried any kind of wrist band?
If so, with what results?
.I'd like to add this symptom relief for vertigo and motion sickness that I found online:  Ginger Root, taken occasionally in 250 mg. doses up to four times a day, is considered safe.
If interested, I suggest doing some research first.
i hate everything and everybody more or less and i constantly talk about war stories and running away to california.
did i mention i hate EVERYTHING & EVERYBODY.
and like i havent done d in like 6 months but i been drinking a lot cause i cant function with everything that goes on in my head and i constantly think about needles like every two seconds.
Hey everyone, my name is Charity and I am new to the group.
Just within the last few months my husband has told me that he feels like he is a woman trapped in a man's body.
When we first started dating he told me that he wanted to dress up and other things, so I always had a feeling but I guess I just didn't want to see it.
We have only been together for 15 days in the last 8 months because of our jobs, so we can't really sit down and talk face to face.
He is upset because even though I support him 110%, I don't understand how he feels.
I will never leave him, but on the other hand I feel like I am losing the man that I love.
He told me that he is still that person, and that his penis shouldn't play a part in how much I love him.
I am just looking for advice and support, because I just feel so lost right now (probably because he is going overseas for work for the next year, and I am almost 19 weeks pregnant).
I look forward to hearing from y'all..Charity
Here are a few links that have worksheets and additional information for dealing with PTSD and a variety of other issues like Anxiety, Anger, etc.
which have helped me greatly - .http://www.psychologytools.org/ptsd... .http://www.moodjuice.scot.nhs.uk/posttrauma.asp .http://www.helpguide.org/mental/pos... .http://getselfhelp.co.uk/selfhelpas... .I know a lot are PTSD based but so much of this information is the same for DID/MPD.
With MPD/DID you may want to check with your therapist or whomever you see to discuss some of these things.
Most of the helpful things are for grounding, mindfulness, dealing with anxiety, anger, sleep, healthy living, etc..Hope some can benefit from these!
Hey folks...
I live in a state where we can legally marry and after 6 years  we had one hell of a wedding.
We took a great honeymoon and then got back to work after that and busy with our lives.... Now that we are back to normal, things are anything but that.
She is super volitile and picks on EVERYTHING I do and everything about my family;   imporant to note that I'm extremely close to my family and she is incredibly welcome with open arms.
I can do no right these days....
I sit here tonight desperate to find some support so I do not  have to end my very short marriage.
Let me add that in discussions, she has admitted to being freaked out by being married and that is a big issue.
I am giving that some validation but I am still out here feeling very alone..Please...
has anyone had this experience?
I've heard and read about it in the straight world but never thougt it would happen to us.
Check out the website earthclinic.com for natural remedies and excercises for sciatic pain relief.
I use a tennis ball, sit on it, I put it on the left side under my butt area where the pain comes from.
They also have other natural remedies listed to relieve the pain.
My pain started up again after I had a bad stomach flue, I think it is due to depletion of nutriens from that flue that my sciatic started up again.
Hope this was of any help.
Peace and Love.
Im new at all this internet stuff and new to this group.
after a bad marriage and a not healthy at all relationship after that, I found out that I have hepc , the virus level since treatment has went from millions to a big FAT zero, but I still have alot more treatments to go before Im cured for good!
I have learned that I AM A SPECIAL PERSON!
if and when I do decide to go there again, you see its like im a virgin again and I WILL NOT JUST GIVE MYSELF TO ANYONE!so having this second chance at life (really) is great ,
I want to start this by saying that I know how fortunate I have been to be RR for 15 yrs.
I have had several constant issues such as fatigue & fine motor issues.
(I can no longer write legible)  The last time I saw my MS Nurse we talked about how someone knows if they are leaving RR to 2ndary Progressive.
She explained to me that most patients & Drs can't accurately state the happening until it has already happened.
It's more of a look back & see how much progression u have had over a set amount of time.
(I hope I haven't confessed u already)  I have really been thinking about this lately because of the changes I am experiencing.
For example; my hands/fingers have been more difficult to type with.
Today I took my daughter shopping for summer sales.
I usually take smaller steps & fall a little behind.
But today, as well as several times during the last month, after I've walked for appt.
30-40 minutes it becomes more difficult to NOT DRAG my right leg.
Today when we were driving home I began having pain/soreness in my right thigh.
Is this change suggest that I am moving away from RR to 2ndary Progressive.
Those of u that 'switched', how did u know?
Of course my leg may also be acting like this because the weather  is getting hotter as well as more humid..Anything you can share will be most appreciated.
I have been on topomax, zonigram, depakote, magnesium, steroids, and now I am on Percocet for the pain.
I am allergic to relpax and any forms of medication like relpax and imitrex.
I do get Botox but it has not kicked in yet.
I was just wondering what other forms of treatment others have used and if they work.
Yesterday I visited the one and only sister I talk to.
We're close and she, like me, have been through a lot.
Through counseling and each other's support we've been able to be pretty much the only two siblings (out of 7) that have been able to be and remain closer..Yesterday she told me something I didn't know.
When she was 18 I know that my parents retired and moved to another state and she stayed.
At that time I was dealing with a lot of crap myself so I wasn't there for her they way I wanted (and later was)..She told me that my parents left her on the streets for 3 days.
She was homeless for 3 days.
I never knew that.
My parents were disappointed at her because she did not want to go back to be a Jehovah's Witness as they were.
She told me that the elders in the congregation advised my parents to wait till she was 18 to leave her out.
And they did..Then when my sister was 32 - after ending up in a domestic violence situation, scammed out of $2,000, having to go to court to prosecute the a-hole that beat her, then sharing a room with me in a drug and bum infested hotel, both of use living out of her part-time $7/hr job, taking care of me unable to work, depressed and having PTSD episodes - I was now back on my feet, back on track, on good treatment, prospering, she had her now husband and new family, a degree in Graphic Arts and a great well-paying job at a comedy-related TV network..We came out stronger than ever (though still with issues to deal with), and we have managed to put our lives together with each other's support.
Definitely not perfectly but we've had many great moments with joy and laughter..14 years after leaving her on the streets left to her own devices, our mother decided to call her to ask how she was doing.
And she had good news.
The Jehovah's Witnesses changed their policies on people they shun away and now she can call her, so she was expecting my sister to be very happy about it..My sister of course confronted her about their decision when she was 18.
My mother tried every excuse, every guilt trip, every Bible passage, every Watchtower article, every trick she had used in the past to shame us and psychologically abuse us.
My sister didn't fall for any of them.
I mean, 14 years of good recovery and taking care of ourselves on our own is more than enough time to know what to say if abusers come back for more abuse.
After that conversation my mom never called her again..Then about a year after that, my father called her.
My father is a religious fanatic jackass depraved pedophile who believes that his magic Jehovah makes everything he does right.
So my sister was on her way to her husband's aunt's birthday and she told my father.
The Jehovah's Witnesses don't celebrate birthdays (some stupid BS nonsense about that's supposed to be a sin or some shit I no longer care to remember)..So when he heard what my sister said, he said that she was being disrespectful to him!
My sister said, you asked me how I'm doing and what I'm up to.
Well, I'm fine and going to a birthday party that I planned.
He tried to start preaching to her!
She told me that she only said how pathetic and hung up..Now I really understand why my parents ask me about her when I talk to them, and why my sister forbid me to tell them anything, which I respect and do of course..I feel happy that my sister got it right.
I'm glad that she told me and that we have developed the sibling closeness that we meant to have.
She is doing the right thing, and she cut the ties with our parents as I should have..As sad as it is that I have to talk about my own parents the way I have to, we both know that cutting ties with the rest of our Christian-for-when-it's-convenient-to-them-only family was the right thing.
And I feel the luckiest man alive to have a sister like her.
She's the best and stronger woman I've ever had the pleasure to know in person.
Just Posted:.Awesome article on HE.
Note the comments about protein - protein is terribly important to counter malnutrition which is prevalent in cirrhotic patients.
Note also the use of B Vitamins for treating the affects of HE..Enjoy?

Oh my goodness I am so overwhelmed and scared right now.
I just got my schedule for school today and realized how much I am taking on.
I am taking all advanced classes and already commited to some other things.
Normally I would be able to handle this just fine, but there is so much family drama in  my life that...well i feel like i am breaking at the cracks.
.Any advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks so much
Basically this is my situation.
As many have known, over 2-3 years I have suffered a really terrible dating life, and the whole story of how my first ex boyfriend had scarred me for life.
Basically what the situation is now, is I am finally in the most amazing relationship that I could ask for, and as of July 4 I may not come back home a virgin..I'm really excited as far as my first sleep over with him and spending time with him, however, there is a lot on my mind about it too.
I want to make sure when I loose it to him, he will be the one worth loosing it to.
I remember a lot of pain and retribution I had trying to recover from my first relationship hurt, and I don't want it to kill me just as bad in the end if I have a first serious relationship hurt.
He is a promising person.
From what I know his longest relationship was 4 years.
Me only having a long lasting relationship of 5 months, with a 6 month trauma friends with benefits period.
He goes above and beyond what I expect in someone, and he is so sincere.
I feel very comfortable when I am with him.
I always miss him so much because we live far from each other, and usually it's when I'm not with him that makes me feel the way I do about the matter of me having sex with him for the first time.
Is it love or some kind of abandonment fear dominating that?
My guess is the second one.
=/.My mom explained to me before how I can't keep going along in my future holding the past in hand, but is there some way I can use what I learned less effectively where I feel like I have to be nervous?
It took me awhile to get over the fear of falling in love again, but the whole concept of sex is really new to me.
The whole thing of being in a serious relationship over all is new to me.
I know I don't have to push myself to have sex with him and over all, he doesn't pressure me about the matter anyway, but how can I over come that fear of being hurt again, so when I loose my virginity to him I can just keep things neutral like they've always been?
Over time I've just become a responsible prioritive person, and sometimes just trying to have fun or just going with the flow in certain things (like my new relationship) I can't function like that like I used to, because I know what things are like and I know the consequences.
It's like I have fun with a toy, but I'm aware of that warning label on the box..Any advice or guidance is appreciated thank you.
Lets start our day together..this morning I had 20 oz of flavored ice water while I watched the weather channel..Retrived my walking cloths out of my rm and dump on floor next to recliner..got dressed while I had coffee while I watched the local news..had org juice while I tended to in box e mail..Went out on stoop and down the steps  out to street.
I walked to end to other end and back inside my home.
the walk took aprox 4 minutes..your excuse to not take 5 minutes to walk, hum.
yes no matter what you might think  that others are thinking and lie that your own mind might be saying.
You can fit 5 minutes into your daily routin..I walk total time of 1 hour a day.
due to my legs/feet I seem to fall a lot but I can bounce back up.
I take my cane with me.
when I go to mall I take my walker.
at discount stores I use carts for support..yes.
5 minutes a day is durable.
every bit does make a diffrance..Once mo I have soup week, a 3 day fast, week of only veg w daily banana..let go of bread/white flour, sugar, grease, salt..All store foods already have salt in them so discard the table n cooking salt..after we return in from walk n  change our cloths.

yes do have ice water.
water and more water.Have all the leaf salads and water you can hold..will.
I'm on my way out door at 7AM for my 4 minute walk..how will you be starting your day ?.Tip.
always drink water before r during a meal..It is best to fill up on leaf salad before going out to eat.
and for those who still think that they half to have pizza.
eat lots of salad before r with max of 2 pc.
's of small pizza..May everyone day be as they wish.
may everyone thave and keep a strong hold of our health..Our health is the best investment that we have n ever will have..God bless X's

Hello, I'm new and I was wondering if anyone ever developed chronic, unrelenting vertigo along with their mito?.I have two daughters (16 and 18) and they have both developed unrelenting vertigo.
They have it 24/7.
My 16-year-old has a feeding tube, as the nausea from the vertigo has caused her to loose so much weight.
The neurologist isn't 100% certain it's mito, but he highly suspects it.
His theory is that their bodies don't produce enough energy to make their Vestibulo ocular reflex work properly.
They are mostly house-bound, as too much movement makes them more dizzy.
They take a lot of medication to control it, but it's working less and less all of the time.
If we could get the vertigo to stop, their lives would improve dramatically.
They cannot read, write, ride in a car, watch TV/movies, ride in an elevator or up an escalator, busy patterns, etc.
all make it worse.
Anybody ever experience this?
They've battled this severe form for a little over a year, but one or the other has battled this off and on all of their lives.
They are talking about my Gd needing an operation when hjer curve reaches 50 degrees  It is 46 degrees now  She just turned 13  Has anyone else had this operation where they fuse the back  Any advice is very appreciated  I am really worried I dont know whether to let them operate or not Please any advice or comments
Long story short...my inlaws love to brag about their kids.
My mil would call just to tell me the latest news about her other grandchildren.
I never heard her talk about my kids that way to others.
Her kids seem to be the same way....at least to me it seems this way.
.So the other night we were visiting and my sil told me that her college graduate son lost his job after just a few months and hasn't been able to get another job.
Her other child has one more year of undergrad but won't be able to get into the grad program they want because of grades..In my heart I was doing a little happy dance when I heard all of this.
I feel bad for the kids and hope that they will get what they want.
But part of me felt so good to find out that the perfect grand kids aren't so perfect.
I think I'm jealous that my mil favored these kids.
Also angry at her because my kids knew she favored the others.
And also a justified since all the bragging didn't turn out the way they expected.
.I'm really struggling right now.
Part of me feels terrible but at the same time I'm feeling good.
Most of my anger is directed at my mil but she is not alive so I can't fix that.
Any suggestions on how to sort out my feelings?

I don't know where to begin.
I am on Subooxone and they do work for me.
The past 1 1/2 months I have been going into a depression that I have never felt before.
I am so bummed out right now that I don't want to do nothing but lie down, I'm not eating good, I don't sleep, and I constantly think I am missing something out there when I know I'm not.
It's getting to the point where I wouldn't care if I woke up or not.
i am entertaining the thought of a hot shot to end this feeling.
I have no direction, and I don't want to talk to anyone about it either.
I am sick of these f*****g Dr's telling me how I feel from the pages of a medical book.
I don't want to be put on a cocktail of meds that will take me out of myself.
I want this miserable existance to end and I want it to end now.
Can someone please help me.
I feel like I am about to do something real bad.
Please help !!!!!

This entire mess has my whole life jacked up and I cant seem to get it off of my mind.
(SIGH)
I guess I\u2019d like to start by saying I came here to overcome shame at what happened.
I felt guilt because I instigated part of what I experienced.
I have over come much of my experience in the five years since I got out..My situation was a little different.
I was in a spiritually and financially abusive situation with a couple I was friends with.
After four years, I moved them into my home.
I was a single working professional, with a degree in social work.
Yet not only did I let them take me for all I had financially, but this happened too..In February of 2013, on my birthday, I had taken the husband with me to the city.
I had a work conference and I was paying for him to get some dental work.
While I went out with an old friend for my birthday supper, he got drunk..When I came back to the room, I was tired and went to bed.
To make a long story shorter, he tried to bully me into being physical ( and tried to tell me God said it was okay- Prqise God I knew that was a load of manure!).
Because he knew I once was a little attracted to him, he wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.
I had the blankets over my head and the only thing I could do or say to stop him was to tell him over and over that I cared too much for his wife (a friend of mine) to do that to her .
Eventually, after undoing his zipper and exposing himself to me, and me staying under the covers praying and crying (thank God I saw nothing!
), he left me alone and I cried myself to sleep..ive pretty much worked through that part.
I know what he did was wrong, bullying, emotional abuse, and sexual misconduct to say the very least.
I thought I was good..A few months later (another long story) they moved out of my home.
A few months after that I married my husband, a pastor.
I have had little to do with them since, but have had some contact with his wife as we were friends..yesterday morning, I ended up talking to quite a bit by text.
A friend of hers had died, I was supporting her, and it felt like old times.
It went well..i woke up at 3am this morning, and I guess it\u2019s time for me to heal some more.
I thought, like I\u2019m sure we all do at some point, that I was past that and pretty much healed up.
But obviously God knew better.
That conversation knocked some things loose.
After much prayer and discussion with my husband and a friend, I have decided that if the friendship is going to continue, I must tell her.
I am comfortable with that.
She is still in that abusive situation, with her kids, and I\u2019m one of few people who understand and have the strength to stand up to him..what I really learned this morning is that I still had great shame over the second part of what happened, what happened the next day.
And when I tell her, I have to tell her all of it.
So after prayer, I found this group.
I need to be free of shame and a little more comfortable talking about it before I tell her, and I need to know that I know that what happened the next day was no more my fault than what happened that night..The next day, I couldn\u2019t concentrate on y conference and I was useless for work.
Bi think this happened in part because of how hard he\u2019d pushed me and how hard i\u2019d Had to stand up to him.
The day after how hard he pushed me, I compromised and offered him some physical satisfaction.
I have always I k own I would be a virgin on my wedding day, and I was.
But I didn\u2019t expect it to be that close, and i never expected to be coerced like that..So, through prayer I have come here, to talk about that next day, and to fully overcome feelings of shame.
I now realize that my actions of that second day were as much his fault as his actions the day before....but I need some reinforcement in this area..Thank you for reading this, in advance for your support, and for welcoming me in your midst.
I am dealing with so much stress right now!
I just graduated from my masters and applied to a doctorate program.
I did get an interview and interviewed last week.
I really hope I get accepted.
So far I haven't gotten any news.
Cross your fingers!!!!

If you don't mind me asking I don't have a for sure diagnosis but what type of symptoms did you have prior to your diagnosis I first had breast cancer then went to my colon but I'm getting urinary tract infections upper and lower back pain bone pain and pain into my left arm their also you g to be doing at ct scan on my kidneys too but if you don' mind Sharing that would be great on what sy.ptoms you had I also have nausea dry heaves fatigue don't sleep well pain.
Keeps me up at night I don't get more than 3hrs a night of sleep.
To start of my name is Maggie and I am 13.
Today (the day after saint.P day, the 17th) I found out my sister is trans gender.
She is now going to become a boy.
It is so hard for me to process this, like I know what begins transgender is but I've never experienced it befor.
She (or he I think) doesn't evan know I know yet, my mom told me.
Don't worry my mom had permission.
But it fells like a lose, because I won't have a big sister any more and it'll just be my mom and I as the only girls in the family.
I fell so alone because no one else at my school is going through this.
I kinda fell that I've been put on the back burner and that my parents don't think that her change will effect me.Anyone just please help I don't know what to feel.
Hello,.My mom is disabled and no longer able to walk due to health problems.
Being that she is now wheelchair bound, we are looking into getting her a power chair.
(electronic wheelchair).Do any of you have any suggestions on what is good?
What to stay clear of?
Things to look for?
.This is all new to us and we are a little overwhelmed with the options..Thanks :)

I really hate to admit this, but I have been struggling with the feeling that I am not good enough for my boyfriend, job, life.
This all seems silly and immature, but I can't shake the feeling.
I feel like I should be better in many aspects of life.
This causes me to feel jealous when I think about better girls my boyfriend could be with.
Its not a nice feeling.
I have always been really hard on myself, but not feeling adequate enough for my partner is tough.
Sam has started a new tic...it's like he is saying TOMB.
But it's almost like a whisper.
TOMB TOMB TOMB TOMB over and over.
Holy cow, I finally said SAM, CAN YOU CHANGE YOUR TIC, PLEASE?
He just laughed and said he wished!
He said he didn't like that one either.
So...I have him chewing gum until this one stops..UGH!
I am ok with the tics that I know, but when a new one gets thrown in, it takes me awhile to adjust.
.I am thinking the prozac is not working.
We will see what the doc says when we go back in two weeks..I apologize for not being on much--I had VBS this past week and start 4 classes tomorrow, so will be busy, but still thinking of everyone!.Kathy
Does anybody know if medicare covers cryoablation?
I have been diagnosed with prolactinemia, but not I have not had an MRI so I don't know if there is a tumor.
I suffer from anxiety and OCD as well.
I'm curious about some symptoms that I have.
Pretty much anything that happens to me, I blame my anxiety..Anyway, for the last six months or so, I've been having incredibly vivid, often violent dreams.
I used to get these maybe once or twice a year and then they just started happening more frequently.
At this point, it's every day.
I started Prozac 20 mgs in February and in April increased to 40 mgs to help with OCD.
Could Prozac cause these dreams?.Also, I've been getting these waves of exhaustion.
It just hits me and I'm so incredibly tired.
It's actually pretty frightening and of course that makes my anxiety hit the roof.
.Just wondering if any of you have experienced anything like these.
If this is a group of jealous people, then I'm sure we won't get the best advice from one another (heck, we're all jealous), but we'll see what happens..So my story, in short, is this: I've had very few serious relationships prior to getting married, my wife has had many prior to getting married.
She's really outgoing, and I am not.
We've been married for 10 years, and one of our challenges has been my jealousy.
I feel I've improved greatly over stupid stuff, but here recently, she got in touch with a male cousin she hadn't talked to since she was a kid.
They now seem to be BFFs and are texting each other all day long for a couple weeks now.
It just seems super excessive and a little weird.
Her and I will be in the same room hanging out, and she'll text him just to see what he's up to.
She doesn't really do this with anyone else, and the couple of female friends she's tried to talk to excessively have not been nearly as responsive as he is.
He's in a bad relationship with his wife, and I think that's why he looks for validation elsewhere.
The real question here is: just because he is her cousin, does that make all of this completely benign?
She seems to think that one fact should totally do away with me being jealous..What are your thoughts?
I posted in the heart attack group too but it's a little slow over there lately.. .It always bothers me when any doctor doesn't listen to my heart and lungs..
But it REALLY bothers me when my CARDIOLOGIST doesn't.
.Isn't it just good practice to listen to the heart and lungs??
Especially when you are there because of a skipping beat going crazy..
I mean I realize I will always have this skipping beat but usually when it goes crazy there is a reason (and have yet for it to be a good reason)..
So it just seems to me before your cardiologist says nothing is wrong it's just the nature of the beast shouldn't he at the very least listen to it?
He had ordered an ECHO with CONTRAST but I never got to speak to him about it, and even the nurse didn't get back with me in time so I canceled that echo because I had valid questions about it.
.Now he says I don't even need any echo.
I'm considering changing doctors but in my little town all cardiologist are in the same clinic and for me to change to another would put me driving a little over an hour each way to see which is fine, but it's interstate driving and I really hate doing that alone for some reason.. Age..
I blame age.. LOL  .What do you all think?
well..happy 'go red for women' day!!!!
a group i didnt ever think i would belong to , but couldnt function without...women with heart disease....so to celebrate...haha...i have decided to buy myself a new medical alert bracelet...!!!
!woo hoo...i already have a nice bracelet looking one with the band that has my info on the inside..i might get another bracelet from the same company so i dont have to buy a new tag....its fun shopping...even if its for a medical bracelet.....enjoy your day everyone!!!
i may actually go out clothes shopping this weekend...depends on my fatigue level, but at least i will have a new bracelet...!!

Hi.
I was just wondering how to lose weight when I have so much pain.
I have fibro, degenerative disc in back and osteoarthritis in knees.
I have a hard time getting up.
But then when I am up I hurt from head to toe.
I cut back on eating and still don't loose.
I get so depressed when I look at myself.I used to weight 140 but now 260.
Any ideas would greatly appreciated.
I am struggling with being a care giver to my husband.
He was in a car accident seven years ago and it changed him.
we believe it is frontal lobe damage.
Doctors, meds, therapy we have tried it.
He refuses to go to a support group.
(He thinks they just want him to sue people and I can't go unless he has an attorney.
That's what he says).He no longer is the person I fell in love with.
I know that person will never return.
My husband is still looking for the magic fix.
Each time something doesn't return him to normal (his words) he falls harder and faller away from me.
I get the backlash of his frustations and anger.
I sheild out children and my husband as much as possible.
.We have reached the end of our ropes again and again.
He makes promises that I know he cannot keep, and gets angry at me when I discuss his limitations in ability to keep promises..He is great at expressing anger (all frustration and fear turns into anger), but cannot express positive emotions.
.I continue to want to help him, but I am frustrated with his refusal to accept his changed personality..Does anyone have suggestions on how to get him to accept the change so we can really work on our relationship?
I'm glad to have read some posts regarding nieces.
I obtained legal guardianship after my sister was in a tragic car accident.
One struggle I have is with my parents.
To my parents, my niece (their only granddaughter) can do no wrong.
She has them completely wrapped around her finger and she knows it.
My other two kids know it too.
When I discipline her, or not allow her to do something, she always calls grandma.
I'm being tattled on, can you imagine!
My mom knows about every plan me and my husband make, every mistake my other kids make, every disagreement we have because my niece tells all to my mom.
I realize that they were very close, even when my sister was alive.
I don't want that to change, but I don't want every detail of my house reported to my parents.
I notice that I catch myself when I get after her...what will my mom say?
How is this fair to the others, how is this fair to her?
She is part of the family, but this is always hanging over me.
Maybe its been so long that I expect it now, and its not really there.
Of course some days are worse than others...and I know it could just be my anxiety of trying to do everything right and make everyone happy.
Anyway.....thanks for reading.
What is 2A Hodgkin's Lymphoma?
I was only told I had Hodgkin's Lymphoma in stage 4.
only at night feedings before bed to get her to sleep but im really tired of it lol.
but its like her comfort she barely eats its more like she just wants it there.
i need help or tips to stop.
I feel so lost.
My life is nothing I thought it would be, I didnt have the best parents growing up in a big family the middle child, I had a baby when I was 15 I chose to keep him.
but as he became a teen he really stopped listening and respecting me, Ive chosen the worst men out of low self esteem.
done things I totally regret from taking xanax drinking and blacking out.
ive disconnected from almost everyone in my life.
I feel so dehabilitaded.
Idk what to do.
I was joined a residential center for anger management after i started becoming too violent with my dad.
I was released after 21 days and now i have been cured of my anger management issues and now i am happy with my dad.
I just wanted to know whether it is shameful to join a residential center for anger management and whether it was necessary to join an residential center
Just started taking Clomid.
I read that one of the possible side effects is that it can dry up your cervical mucus.
Which is a bit of a pain if your trying to get pregnant.
Anyone have any suggestions on how to combat this problem?
i know what cystitis is...the other term i'm not so sure about.
thanks
My partner and I have just moved in together and are having difficulties after a seven year long term friendship.
Without doubt one of the biggest struggles within tghe relationship atm is communication with my belief that we know so much indepth knowledge about each other.
However, with the fear of this reolationship going the way my last one did I have been trying really hard to communicate with my partner.
It's my belief which has been confirmed by my partner tonight that the biggest hinderance to our relationship is her ex who is prohibiting her from having more contact with her children than what she currently does.
While there are circumstances that the ex partner 's using against us as a couple I feel my partner's ex partner is holding the children to ransom.
Has anyone else been in this situation and what did you do?
I never imagined in a million years imagined this would be such a struggle.
I had so many times wished he was gone and just imagined I would feel peace.
I have moments I feel ok about myself, but more often it's doubt, self criticism and absolutely no idea what to do with myself.
I have alwyas had low self esteem.
I am a bit of an introvert.
I have been told so many times I am not a real woman and will never be able to maintain a normal relationship by him.
Told I am more sensitive and emotional than anyone he ever encountered.
The lines between what is real and what is not blur.
I know I have things to work on within myself, but I don't think these flaws justified the treatment I was handed.
I want to sleep all the time so I don't have to think.
Hi everyone, I was wondering if someone could help me out a bit, When I was young and at school I always got pushed around easily if someone hit me because they didn't like me I would just let them I never hit them back, even some friends did this from time to time but obviously at that age I just put up with it.
.My Dad always told me to hit anybody back that hit me and I never did and I know this really frustrated him..When I got to about 18 I was seriously assaulted by my friends drunk dad  he made a bit of a mess out of me and I never hit him back once..I am not sure why I would never hit back I used to take the punches and walk away..Anyway in my mid twenties I changed, I would blow my top very easy little things that someone did to me would make me explode, I still didn't hit out because I kind of scared people with my crazy actions so people didn't really risk hitting me they would back off..I had started Martial arts and I had done a really short stint in the forces mainly to make my dad proud and to be honest I felt like I could do anything, but my anger got worse I started to hate everybody that was rude or obnoxious to me little things would make me loose the plot like for example holding the door open for a stranger and they would just walk through without thanking you, just little things like that...Then one night I got in a fight it was the first real fight I had ever had and first fight since my friends dad had assaulted me when I was younger..I really scared myself when I had this fight  I let everything out basically a guy glassed me and the rest is history..The more the years went on the worse I got not getting into fights but trying to come off some sort of hard man and getting angry at anything..Then today aged 35 two builders in a van nearly ran over me I swore at them and they stopped the van and both got out, again I was not scared I just faced up to them and they both really set on me and I mean set on me..I wouldn't stay down I just kept getting up saying things like 2 versus 1 very fair why not try me 1 on 1 I barely threw a punch I would have but they were all over me the last time I got up they left me and I walked off..Then it hit me and I mean hit me I thought what the hell am I doing what's going on why am I doing things like this, I am grown man and getting into fights what is going on??
?..All evening it's been on my mind that I need to sort myself out as I don't want to be like this any more..Sorry it is so long but to get a good picture stories are never short....Steve
Just wanted to ask ppl that may have been addicted to cocaine or crack.

This is bad.

So, we are getting ready to move from NY to MA.
I will be on Warfarin until the end of the summer, at the very least.
I need dental work and want to have it done in the summer before my COBRA insurance runs out and Medicare takes over.
(no dental on Medicare).
.My question is can you go off and on Warfarin by simply stopping for a few days (to have dental work done) and then starting back up again with the same dosage as before?
Hello,.
Typically I am not a huge proponent of fad diets as I am all too familiar with the yo-yo syndrome.
However, I am heading south in two weeks and would like to slim down a bit so I feel half decent in my bathing suit.
I typically eat well and detox frequently but still have a very stubborn 10 pounds that will not go away.
Therefore, I gave in and am on day two of the cabbage soup diet.
I read a great deal of reviews before attempting this and what sold me was that many people posted that after this diet they were very aware of what they were putting into their bodies and maintained a healthy eating life style.
Has anyone else tried this diet and if so what was your experience on it?.Thanks for the support,.Lorraine
Whenever your dear is in the serious level of heartatack and doctors has disshoped her this maybe ignite a little hope in you search and read about cryonics.Plz for your dear copy this in similar sites or similar anywhere

Who wants to ravish me and how?
Hi there, im hoping i can get help here.my father is a 56 year old man, who has previously had 5 heart attacks, quadruple bypass 10 years ago & has LSVD (Left ventricular systolic heart failure) i think its called!.he has lost an extreme amount of weight since October, extreme nausea, vomiting, weight loss, urinating frequently, confused, extremely weak & tired, out of breath.he still is a smoker.hes health has deteriorated since the last few months & doctors have requested a CT SCAN but this is not until 4 months yet..could this be a later stage of heart failure & does he need to be hospitalised?
As he is putting off going to the hospital because he hates them..i am hoping to take him to A & E tomorrow as the doctors seem very clueless..His cardiologist before has told him he needs a pacemaker but refused.
I am hoping this will encourage him to have one done..Please can someone help me get some answers?
Could this be the end stages?
I have asked for advise in this forum and even answered a question or two, yet there is very little activity, so I am leaving this particular group.
Good luck to everybody.
I have been having these dreams that are so obscure.
I wake not being able to actually remember them but the one clear message in them is that I am being sought out by an evil entity.
I can not articulate this into words.
It is just a giant darkness.
I feel emotionally and spiritually spent upon waking.
Like my soul has been ripped out of my torso.
.I have not been given a diagnosis but I really have more than reasonable suspicion that I have severely damaged my liver.
I have some itching, odd headaches, muscle loss, blood clots slowly, skin changes, a little forgetful here and there.
Oh, and a almost persistent dull aching with a few jabbing jolts.
It does radiate to by back as I have read.
Although some of these symptoms also are common with xanax (benzodiazopine) withdrawal which I am currently going through.
.But I work sometimes all day moving furniture, swim a bit, bike at sustained speeds for several miles, I do not feel tired or suffer from any fatigue,  have a great appetite, and even a decent libido for a 46 year old male.
I do not sleep much at all.
Once in a while I do nod off for a half an hour here and there.
The odd thing is if i do feel a bit tired during the day, that sense of sleepiness in much more enjoyable than any type of tiredness i have at night.
Kooky!
!.Thanks,
I can't handle ONE MORE freaking bad thing happening okay?!?!
I'm done that's enough for now!!!!
!.I'm sorry I just can't believe what a mess my life is it's my fault she's going through this and that people use me it's MY FAULT.I had to get that out.
I had to get that out there.
In public, it becomes embarrasing, because others describe it at times as sounding like i'm gagging and going to vomit.
It gets really bad when i get excited, anxious, or just wound up.
How can i deal with this?
My doctor gave me delsym, and put me on the smallest dose.
I took it one time and robo tripped.
And i took the recommended dose.
I measured it and double checked it before i took it.
It was so scary.
I was afraid i was dying.
My mind was so confused.
i couldnt comprehend anything around me.
Me and my grandma don't really have a close relationship.
At moments I like to be alone and not talk, but she always ask me questions and try to talk to me when I dont feel like talking.
Most of the time when we are alone and she try to talk to me, I raise my voice because I don't have any paitients.
I don't want to be mean to her, but I dont like to talk all the time.
How should I tell her that I don't feel like talking without an attitude and without explaining?
If I get a carb from a fruit vs a carb from a sweet, are they treated the same in my body?
When you are carb counting, it doesn't seem to take into acct the source of the carb.
Does that really matter?
Just so I allow for carbs left after a meal, then a sweet treat in moderation is ok and will not adversely affect my blood sugar?.I noticed I lost weight almost immediately after I started this carb counting  diet.
I usually LOVED it when I lost weight because then I felt I can eat some yummy things.
Now, with this carb counting, that isn't so true.
Darn!
Is PTSD normal for those that have been abused and what would the signs be?
Hi  Im new here.
Its nice to see other fans of Web MD etc.
I sympathize with those who steer clear of the medical sites.
I have  always had a general lack of energy and stamina.
